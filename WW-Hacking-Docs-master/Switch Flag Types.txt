A switch flag can have an index from 00-FF.
The range the index is in controls what type of switch it is specifically.
Checking if a switch is currently set is done by calling isSwitch__10dSv_info_cFii.
isSwitch__10dSv_info_cFii will call one of various other more specific functions depending on the type of switch you passed to it.

00-7F: Mem bit. Permanent, saved to the memory card. (Calls isSwitch__12dSv_memBit_cFi)
80-BF: Dan bit. Gets cleared on transition to a stage with a different stage info ID. (Calls isSwitch__12dSv_danBit_cFi)
C0-DF: Zone bit that gets cleared on stage transition. (Calls isSwitch__13dSv_zoneBit_cFi)
E0-EF: Zone bit that gets cleared on stage transition or room transition. (Calls isSwitch__13dSv_zoneBit_cFi)
F0-FE: Zone bit that is invalid and will throw an error if checked.
