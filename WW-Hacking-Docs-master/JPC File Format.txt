.jpc files are particle lists, they're located in the /res/Particle folder.

Particle list header format (0x20 bytes long):
00,08: "JPAC1-00"
08,02: Number of particles in this particle list.
0A,02: Number of textures in this particle list.
0C,14: Padding, just null bytes.

Following the header are a list of particles:
Particle header format (0x20 bytes long):
00,08: "JEFFjpa1"
08,04: ???
0C,04: Number of sections this particle has.
10,04: Length of this entire particle in bytes (the particle header + all the sections for this particle).
14,01: Number of ??? (read by calcKey__14JPABaseEmitter)
15,01: Number of ??? (read by initField__15JPAFieldManager)
16,01: ???
17,01: (Maybe padding?)
18,02: ID number of this particle.
1A,06: Padding, just null bytes.

After each particle header are a number of particle sections:
Particle section format:
00,04: Magic bytes identifying the type of this section.
04,04: Length of this section in bytes.
(The rest varies depending on the type of the section.)

Particle sections:
* BEM1
* FLD1 (optional) (can have multiple per particle)
* KFA1 (optional) (can have multiple per particle)
* BSP1
* ESP1
* SSP1 (optional)
* ETX1 (optional)
* TDB1

BSP1 (Base Shape Arc) section format:
08,?
0C,04: Bitfield
  00080000 - EnableAnmTone
  00400000 - ChildOrder
  0000000F - Type
10,02: Offset to prm color data list.
12,02: Offset to env color data list.
14,04: Base size X (float).
18,04: Base size Y (float).
1C,02: LoopOffset
1E,02: Bitfield
20,02: ColLoopOffset
22,02: TexLoopOffset
24,01: Bitfield
  01 - EnableTextureAnm
  02 - EnableGlobalColAnm
25,01: TextureAnmKeyNum
27,01: Bitfield
  02 - EnablePrmAnm
28,01: Prm color data count.
29,01: Env color data count.
(???): List of texture indexes.
  These are bytes which are indexes in the TDB1's list of texture IDs.
(varies, optional): List of color animation data.

ESP1 (Extra Shape Arc) section format:
0C,04: Bitfield
  00000100 - EnableScale
  0000C000 - PivotX
  00030000 - PivotY

SSP1 (Sweep Shape Arc) section format:
50,1: Texture index.
  This is an index in the TDB1's list of texture IDs.

ETX1 (Ex Tex Shape Arc) section format:
2C,01: IndTextureID
  This is an index in the TDB1's list of texture IDs.
2D,01: SubTextureID

TDB1 (maybe stands for Texture DataBase?) section format:
0C+: List of texture IDs (halfwords).
  The texture ID is an index in the list of TEX1 sections in this JPC file.

After all of the particles are a list of TEX1 sections which contain the actual image data of the particles.
TEX1 section format:
00,04: "TEX1"
04,04: Length of this section in bytes.
08,04: ???
0C,14: Filename?
20,20: BTI header.
40+: BTI data (image data and maybe palette data).
