04 - Forbidden Woods
05 - Tower of the Gods
06 - Earth Temple

  This might be something similar to stage ID 01, where no stages have it set as their stage ID, but it gets used anyway.
  Specifically it seems like some of the event switches here get set by something.
  Other parts of this stage info besides event switches seem unused.
